## Tools for Teaching

We will using the following tools for teaching in our classes:

### Zoom

https://zoom.us/

## Goolge Class Room

https://classroom.google.com/

### Google Colaboratory

https://colab.google/ 

Colab, or ‘Colaboratory’, allows you to write and execute Python in your browser, with:

1. Zero configuration required
2. Access to GPUs free of charge
3. Easy sharing

### Live Share Classroom Lab Lectures

When instructors are teaching a lesson, they can use Live Share to share their project with students, instead of simply presenting their screen. This allows the entire class to follow along with the teacher, while being able to interact with the project on their own. Additionally, the teacher can ask individual students to assist in solving a particular portion of the lesson (e.g. "Which method should we call here?"), which can help in the social aspects of the class, without requiring students to walk up to the front of the room, or even be physically present in the same room (e.g. online courses).

To aid in classroom settings, Live Share enables sharing in read-only mode. Instructors can use read-only mode to enable them to share their projects with students without having to worry about unnecessary or accidental edits being made.

Additionally, Live Share has support to enable up to 30 guests joining into a collaboration session. This way, instructors can have their whole class join into a session and view code together.

To enable this feature:

VS Code: Add "liveshare.increasedGuestLimit":"true" to settings.json.
VS: Set Tools > Options > Live Share > Increased guest limit to "True"

### Online Whiteboarding App: Jamboard

We will be using Google’s Jamboard during my sessions, as it’s free and integrates nicely with the rest of the Google suite. It doesn’t offer unlimited canvas but divides your drawings up into slides similar to Powerpoint. I’ve found this works well to provide your student with reference slides they can use to study.

Note: We can using the Apple iPad with the Apple Pencil with the Jamboard app, which works very well.
